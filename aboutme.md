title: About me

---

#### Research Interest
* Reinforcement Learning / Artificial Intelligence
* Model-Based RL / Planning in Imperfect Domains
* My goal is to design an RL agent that can adapt itself to any inaccuracy in the model. So, the agent should be able to use its model and the online interactions with the environment in the best way possible to capture model inaccuracies and update the model if needed or just ignore the inaccuracies during planning.

#### Academic Background

* MSc in Computing Science (September 2019)
  - I am continuing my education as a master student in Computing Science at University of Alberta from Fall 2019 under supervision of [Dr. Martin MÃ¼ller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/)
  
* BSc in Computer Engineering (September 2015 - July 2019) 
  - I have got BSc degree in Computer Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology ybder supervision of [Dr. Nasser Mozayani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LAAM5tEAAAAJ&hl=en)
